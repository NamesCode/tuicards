# tuicards
*pronounced like cue cards but with a T :)*

**BETA VERSION!!** - Do **NOT** expect this to work perfectly as is. It is currently a beta piece of software. I've only pushed it to Github as I need it on my phone currently.

A simple cue card reader for the terminal!
Cue cards are created using Markdown, with the first line containing a # becoming the title and all other text being displayed below.

## TODO
- [ ] Properly render the tuicards 
- [ ] Render markdown
- [ ] Colours
- [ ] Read a `.config` folder of cards recursively
- [ ] Read a `.config` folder of cards recursively
- [ ] Simple CLI

## Usage
This is unusable in its current state since the file it reads is hard coded.
